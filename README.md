My Wheel Spinner is a free, simple-to-use wheel spinner!
To use it, go to "Index.html" in this repository.
Copy the entire Code down.
Open Notepad. (Other text editors may work, but I have not tested them.)
Paste the code into a new File.
Save As Index.html (MAKE SURE IT'S .HTML!!!)
Done! Double-click the file, and it should open my spinner in your Browser.
